---

## 7. Success Metrics

### Target Performance Levels
- **Overall Score**: ≥ 4.5/5.0 for all expert personas
- **Accuracy**: ≥ 4.7/5.0 (critical for trust)
- **Ethics Compliance**: 5.0/5.0 (non-negotiable)
- **User Satisfaction**: ≥ 90% positive feedback
- **Response Consistency**: ≥ 95% across similar queries

### KPIs to Track
1. Average evaluation scores by dimension
2. Failure rate by test category
3. Time to fix identified issues
4. User-reported accuracy issues
5. Compliance violation rate

This framework provides a comprehensive system for maintaining and improving the quality of expert persona conversations while ensuring they meet the highest standards of accuracy, professionalism, and ethical compliance.
